# Time Drift Detection in Business Process Event Streams

## Description of Objective
Changes - be it internal or external - affect the organization's workflows and therefore the data recorded. This work focuses on detecting concept drifts in the execution time of a business process - the time perspective - in a streaming environment. Fig. shows a graphic visualization of the problem using a simplified production process. Activities in the process are represented as blue boxes. Each product has to be manufactured, delivered and accounted for. However, accounting can be done parallel to manufacturing and delivering, as shown in the concurrent branches. The length of the boxes indicates the execution time needed for this particular activity. From the left process to the right there is a tremendous change in the execution time of the accounting activity indicating a concept drift in the time perspective in this particular process.
